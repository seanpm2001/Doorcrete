# Doorcrete
Doorcrete is currently just a concept: Doorcrete breaks down surveillance/telemetry back doors, and fills them with binary concrete.

## It may be possible

Backdoors don't exactly work like this, but they can be filled/removed.

Doorcrete removes backdoors on mixed source software (when open source contains proprietary elements) and also general open source software. It is much harder to do with proprietary software.

## Telemetry removal

Doorcrete can remove Telemetry on:

* Audacity (an upcoming future release post 3.0.2 is expected to contain Google telemetry, and a boycott for the product is starting to grow - May 6th 2021)

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS/12.10 and up

* GNOME (may not contain telemetry)

* Firefox (contains optional telemetry)

* and more

## Backdoor removal

Backdoors will be "filled with binary concrete" (telemetry sections will be removed, and replaced equally with binary data of the same size with similar functions, so that it isn't detected to be modified in a way the backdoor lover created the backdoor.

## It is easier said than done

Again, this is just a concept. It may not be possible to fully remove telemetry and backdoors from software, and if it is, it sure isn't easy. For now, you can try to take this software out of your life and get better privacy.
